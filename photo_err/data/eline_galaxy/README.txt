The stellar spectrum is a Bruzual and Charlot model with a constant 6 Gyr star formation history at solar metallicity.

The emission lines are an average taken from 6 SDSS specrta near the 90th-percentile of H-alpha equivelant width for nearby (z < .05) star-forming galaxies.  All of the basis SDSS galaxies are classified as starbursts.

The emission lines have a width of ~70 km/s (1.2A), similar to the SDSS measurements.  The underlying stellar spectra has a resultion of ~3A, so they are not matched.  Note that SDSS spectra have an instrumental resolution of 2.7A, so these lines look much stronger than typical SDSS spectra because they are not instrumentally broadened.


Since the B&C model only covered the optical/IR, I "pasted on" an Sc tempalte spectrum from the Gemini ITC:
Spiral (Sc) galaxy - a template spectrum (type Sc, class T=5) covering the wavelength range 22 - 10000 nm and taken from the Pegase Atlas of Galaxies by Fioc & Rocca-Volmerange (1997). The spectrum has a sampling of 1nm at wavelengths shortwards of 878nm and 20nm longwards. (Look at a plot or download the data file).
