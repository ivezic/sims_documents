The top panel shows a map of the number of visits. The bottom two panels show how well stellar magnitudes are recovered by self calibration. By turning off dithering, the self calibration problem is poorly-linked and we are not able to solve the system in parallel. We are able to solve the system without Hexdither if we do not use HEALpixels and solve the entire system simultaneously. }}{14}}

This shows for any individual star, about 60\% of the observations follow a Gaussian distribution with $\sim 5$ mmag RMS, while the other 40\% of the observations are in a much broader tail. This well matches the Opsim input which has about 60\% of observations taken in photometric conditions.
