PWV measured on a single day at Gemini S \citep{Radomski2010}.  Two
techniques were used, GPS and Phoenix, an IR spectrograph, and the
data is in good agreement.  Note the decline of approximately 4 mm
over a period of two hours.  This is a case where use of a single
average atmosphere for a whole night would give poor results,
especially in the y-band.
