\section{Illumination Correction alternate version}

{\it This is text I wrote and then cut from the illumination correction section above.
Looking at the most recent CCOB review, this is what had been suggested for generating
the illumination correction. However, I believe this is confusing and hard to read. 
It's not entirely clear to me that the IC could be determined in this way, rather than
as described above, at least not without describing a model for the IC as above. However,
I'm saving the equations here in case consensus is that they need to be in the IC section.}


After acquiring the CCOB, narrow band dome flat fields, and rastor
scan data, it is then possible to create a model for the illumination
correction by minimizing (in each filter)
\begin{eqnarray}
 \chi^2 & = & \Sigma_{N_{stars}} \left( { m^{star}_{meas}(x,y) - m^{star}_{model}(x,y)
\over \sigma_b} \right)^2  \\
  & & +\, \Sigma_{N_{DS}, x,y,\lambda} \left( {
    ADU^{DS}_{meas}(x,y,\lambda) - ADU^{DS}_{ model}(x,y,\lambda) \over
    \sigma_{DS \, x,y,\lambda } } \right)^2  \nonumber  \\
 & & +\,  \Sigma_{N_{CCOB},x,y,\theta,\phi,\lambda} \left( { 
   ADU^{CCOB}_{meas}(x,y,\theta,\phi,\lambda) - ADU^{CCOB}_{model}(x,y,\theta,\phi,\lambda) \over
   \sigma_{CCOB \,x,y,\theta,\phi,\lambda}}  \right)^2   \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where the measured values above are the measured magnitudes of the stars
from the dense rastor scan (corrected only by the raw synthetic flat
without illumination correction), the measured ADU values from each pixel of the narrow band
flat fields, and the measured ADU values from each pixel from the CCOB
measurements, reported over a range of pixel locations ($x,y$) and incident
angles ($\theta,\phi$) corresponding to the range of light paths for
incoming photons. The model values come from best-fit parameters for each
of these, when the illumination correction is included: 
\begin{eqnarray}
m^{star}_{model}(x,y) & = &  \int {d\lambda \over \lambda} \int d\theta d\phi \, {\textbf[} FP(x,y,\theta,\phi,\lambda) \times \nonumber \\
&& F_\nu^{star}(x,y,\lambda)\,\, S^{atm}(x,y,\lambda)\, \,M(\theta,\phi,\lambda)\,\,R(\theta,\phi,\lambda) {\textbf]} \nonumber \\
 & = & m^{star}_{best} - \delta k_{b}^{atm+sys}(x,y,alt,az,SED,t) - \int d\lambda \, Z_{IC}(x,y,\lambda)
\end{eqnarray}


\begin{eqnarray}
ADU^{DS}_{model}(x,y,\lambda) & = & \int d\theta d\phi \, FP(x,y,\theta,\phi,\lambda) \times  \nonumber \\
& & {\textbf[}  (F_\nu^{DS}(x,y,\theta,\phi,\lambda)\,\, M(\theta,\phi,\lambda)\,\, R(\theta,\phi,\lambda)) 
+ SS^{DS}(x,y,\theta,\phi,\lambda) +  \nonumber \\ 
& & \Sigma_{(x',y')} \int d\theta' d\phi' \,F_\nu^{DS}(x',y',\theta', \phi',\lambda)\,M(\theta',\phi',\lambda)\,G(x',y',\theta',\phi'; x,y,\theta,\phi,\lambda) {\textbf]} \nonumber  \\
 & = & ADU^{DS}_{best}(x,y,\lambda) - 10^{-0.4 \, Z_{IC}(x,y,\lambda)} 
\end{eqnarray}


\begin{eqnarray}
ADU^{CCOB}_{model}(x,y,\theta,\phi,\lambda) & = &  FP(x,y,\theta,\phi,\lambda) \times \nonumber \\
& & {\textbf[}  F_\nu^{CCOB}(x,y,\theta,\phi,\lambda)\,R(\theta,\phi,\lambda) + \nonumber \\
&& \Sigma_{(x',y')} \int d\theta' d\phi' \,F_\nu^{CCOB}(x',y',\theta',\phi',\lambda)\,G(x',y',\theta',\phi';x,y,\theta,\phi,\lambda) {\textbf]} \nonumber \\
& = & ADU^{CCOB}_{best}(x,y,\theta,\phi,\lambda) - 10^{-0.4\,Z_{IC}}(x,y,\lambda) + SS^{DS}_{best}(x,y,\lambda) 
\end{eqnarray} 
where $Z_{IC}$ represents the entire illumination correction,
including pixel scale variations, corrections for ghosting and
corrections for stray light in the synthetic flat, and $FP$ stands for
focal plane response, $M$ for the mirror transmission response, $R$ for the
refractive optics transmission, $G$ is the ghosting expected in this bandpass (calculated from
the ZEMAX model), and $SS$ stands for all other stray/scattered light
that is present in the dome screen flats. The form for
$Z^{IC}$ must account for possible sharp changes at amp boundaries,
and should be multiplied back into the synthetic flat (changing pixel
values in the synthetic flat) rather than just applied as a series of
zeropoint offsets, to improve galaxy photometry. The best fit values ($best$)
for the stars represent their best-fit natural magnitude values, corrected for the wavelength-dependent color
terms from the flat field and atmospheric transmission in order 
to match the observed bandpass, as well as the illumination
correction. The best fit values for the dome screen would be the
best-fit value for the raw ADU counts at each wavelength (generally simply the
photodiode value with some best-fit spatial
variation), combined with the illumination
correction. The best fit value for the CCOB comes directly from the
photodiode measurement - no model fit necessary - however the
stray and scattered light coming from outside the dome screen beam is
not present in the CCOB apparatus (but is part of the illumination
correction) and so must be added back in; in addition,
since the CCOB measures throughput at particular beam incident
angles, the model ADU values are not just evaluated at a particular
wavelength, but also at a particular set of incident angles.
