\section{$y$-band Convergence}
The temperature variations have made it difficult for self calibration to converge.  This appears to be an issue where persistent residual structure combines with the Opsim observing pattern to create coherent structures that cannot be well solved.  Figure~\ref{y_chip} shows an example full-stellar density $y$-band simulation that includes temperature variations.  The offsets caused by the temperature variations are shown in Figure~\ref{dmag_temperature}.  

We have run a set of simulations to test possible solutions.  Each simulation uses a stellar catalog at full density (selected in either $r$ or $y$), and CCD-sized calibration patches.  

This is not a situation where structured noise makes in hard for self cal to converge.  We have run an $r$-band simulation where all the observations were taken through at least 0.1 magnitudes of cloud extinction and it converges fine (Figure~\ref{min_clouds}).  

Trying to expand the self calibration solver to include a gradient on each patch is very computationally expensive, and might not converge to a legitimate solution.  So far, these attempts have all hit the (very high) iteration limit.  Other possible modifications include fitting a gradient for the chip over a set time-span, or using sub-chip size illumination corrections that are assigned every few hours.  

It appears that the temperature errors are able to alias with the Opsim pointings, creating a system that is unstable to large scale modes.  We have seen similar large-scale residuals in the self calibration simulations when there were few ($\sim2-3$) observations per star.  These $y$-band simulations have 30 observations per star, so it is impressive that the relatively small temperature offsets can induce large-scale modes.

The large-scale errors go away if we set the camera rotator angle to a random value for each visit (Figure~\ref{randrot}).  This seems to confirm that the problem is caused by Opsim tending to image neighboring fields consecutively, thus allowing the temperature errors to constructively interfere.  

Another solution is to rotate the camera between exposures.  Figure~\ref{steprot} shows how including a rotation between exposures effects the self calibration solution.  A 5 degree rotation is enough to help immensely, and there  is little advantage to rotating more than 30 degrees.

Another possibility would be to change the Opsim observing pattern to observe every-other field, then fill in the missing fields with the camera at a different rotation angle.  Figure~\ref{90evother} shows the results of rotating every-other visit by 90 degrees.  Flipping every-other observation by 180 degrees actually works quite well (Figure~\ref{180evother}).

One important point is that whenever Opsim re-visits a field during a night, it use the same rotation angle as the first observation of the night.  This is probably the primary cause of the problem, as the errors from the temperature variations will systematically add in this scenario.


Changing the temperature variation time-scale seems to have little effect on the solution.  I'm not sure why that is the case.

1st attepmt at putting in a reasonable rotation angle dithering.  We do not worry about fields that are observed more than 8 times in a night, or when there are multiple sequencial visits to a field.  If the previous rotation angle of the camera is within 10 degrees of the previous observation (on the same night), the camera is rotated 90 degrees.  If the camera is symetric and aligned, rotating on 90 degree intervals will keep objects observed early in the night from falling into chip gaps.

\section{Future Investigations}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Is this a possible failure mode in other filters as well?  It could be a generic problem with slowly varying structured residuals at the chip level.}
\item{Why isn't this a problem for flat field errors?--IT IS.  Adding a 5 mmag variation pattern that is smaller than the patch size makes the solution unstable to large scale errors.}
\item{What happens if we fiddle with the temperature variation time-scale?--not much}
\item{What happens if we use every-other Opsim pointing?  That might solve the problem.--nope.  Not sure why that didn't help...}
\item{What if each raft is given a unique temperature?  Is this an artificial aliasing problem caused by rafts behaving identically?--nope, setting the rafts to unique offsets changes nothing.}
