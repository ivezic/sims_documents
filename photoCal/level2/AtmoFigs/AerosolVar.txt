Lidar measurements of aerosol extinction at 355nm over a single night
near Greenbelt, MD \citep{Veselovskii2013}.  Cerro Pachon is, of
course, a different environment, and is at an altitude 2700m, removing
much of the variability.  Even above that altitude, however,
significant variation on rapid time scales remains.
