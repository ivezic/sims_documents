\section{$y$-band Convergence}
The temperature variations have made it difficult for self calibration to converge.  This appears to be an issue where persistent residual structure combines with the Opsim observing pattern to create coherent structures that cannot be well solved.  Figure~\ref{y_chip} shows an example full-stellar density $y$-band simulation that includes temperature variations.  The offsets caused by the temperature variations are shown in Figure~\ref{dmag_temperature}.  

We have run a set of simulations to test possible solutions.  Each simulation uses a stellar catalog at full density (selected in either $r$ or $y$), and CCD-sized calibration patches.  

This is not a situation where structured noise makes in hard for self cal to converge.  We have run an $r$-band simulation where all the observations were taken through at least 0.1 magnitudes of cloud extinction and it converges fine (Figure~\ref{min_clouds}).  

Trying to expand the self calibration solver to include a gradient on each patch is very computationally expensive, and might not converge to a legitimate solution.  So far, these attempts have all hit the (very high) iteration limit.  Other possible modifications include fitting a gradient for the chip over a set time-span, or using sub-chip size illumination corrections that are assigned every few hours.  

It appears that the temperature errors are able to alias with the Opsim pointings, creating a system that is unstable to large scale modes.  We have seen similar large-scale residuals in the self calibration simulations when there were few ($\sim2-3$) observations per star.  These $y$-band simulations have 30 observations per star, so it is impressive that the relatively small temperature offsets can induce large-scale modes.

The large-scale errors go away if we set the camera rotator angle to a random value for each visit (Figure~\ref{randrot}).  This seems to confirm that the problem is caused by Opsim tending to image neighboring fields consecutively, thus allowing the temperature errors to constructively interfere.  

Another solution is to rotate the camera between exposures.  Figure~\ref{steprot} shows how including a rotation between exposures effects the self calibration solution.  A 5 degree rotation is enough to help immensely, and there  is little advantage to rotating more than 30 degrees.

Another possibility would be to change the Opsim observing pattern to observe every-other field, then fill in the missing fields with the camera at a different rotation angle.  Figure~\ref{90evother} shows the results of rotating every-other visit by 90 degrees.

This simulation had three ``cold rafts''.  Even if all the rafts are set to a similar temperature the calibration has trouble converging.  \label{dmag_temperature}}

\section{Future Investigations}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Is this a possible failure mode in other filters as well?  It could be a generic problem with slowly varying structured residuals at the chip level.}
\item{What happens if we use every-other Opsim pointing?  That might solve the problem.--nope.  Not sure why that didn't help...}
\item{What if each raft is given a unique temperature?  Is this an artificial aliasing problem caused by rafts behaving identically?--nope, setting the rafts to unique offsets changes nothing.}
